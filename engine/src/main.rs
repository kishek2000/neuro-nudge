//! This module defines the recommendation engine, NeuroNudge.
//! NeuroNudge is an unsupervised learning algorithm for young kids
//! with ASD.
//!
//! The goal of this algorithm is to develop a learning profile of
//! young learners who have ASD and accordingly provide lessons that
//! they can use to make progress. It aims to use reinforcement
//! learning and be sensitive to the different factors that exist for
//! a learner with ASD, such as their duration in answering a question,
//! the number of incorrect attempts, and so forth.
//!
//! This project simply explores the development of the algorithm and
//! tests it with data that simulates some potential young learners
//! (using GPT). It does NOT provide an application experience for the
//! learning.
//!
//! The engine will be based on Reinforcement Learning.
//!
//! A rough guide of how the engine might operate:
//! 1. The algorithm starts with a set of default recommendations for
//!    the child's initial state.
//! 2. The child interacts with the e-learning platform (e.g., by
//!    answering questions or completing activities).
//! 3. Based on the child's interactions and their current state, the
//!    algorithm suggests new modules or activities, adjusting
//!    difficulty levels, as needed.
//! 4. The child's responses and reactions are continuously monitored.
//!    If the child is engaged and achieving learning objectives, the
//!    algorithm continues with similar recommendations.
//!    If the child seems disengaged or frustrated, the algorithm may
//!    adjust the content, provide hints, or modify the difficulty level.
//! 5. Over time, the algorithm learns from the child's behavior and
//!    refines its recommendations to maximize the child's learning
//!    experience and satisfaction.
//!
//! Note that the state and types for stuff like learner, lesson etc are
//! defined in the `types` module.
