# NeuroNudge - unsupervised learning algorithm for young kids with ASD.

NeuroNudge is an unsupervised learning algorithm for young kids with ASD. The goal of this algorithm is to develop a learning profile of young learners who have ASD and accordingly provide lessons that they can use to make progress. It aims to use reinforcement learning and be sensitive to the different factors that exist for a learner with ASD, such as their duration in answering a question, the number of incorrect attempts, and so forth.

This project simply explores the development of the algorithm and tests it with data that simulates some potential young learners (using GPT). It does NOT provide an application experience for the learning.

To understand more about the algorithm and approach see the report pdf.
